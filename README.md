# Advanced   Passive   Radar     Library

pyAPRiL is a python based DSP library which implements passive radar algorithms. The ultimate goal of the library is to make available the so far ellaborated passive radar algorithms to everyone including sceintific researchers, radar system designers and amateurs. All the implemented methods are tested and verified through real-life systems, field measurements and simulations.

### Project guidelines:
- This project respects the authors of all the contributions, therfore references are always highlighted where applicable.
- Understanding the operation of the implemented algorithms is always of primary importance. The efficient execution and concise coding do not belong to the principles of the project, but encoured  when it is not at the expense of comprehensibility and does not change the essential operation of the originally proposed algorithm.
### Contributions:
Contributions are welcome from anyone who shares the passion of passive radars and wants to help make opensource passive radar community even better. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, there are plenty of ways to get involved and contribute to pyAPRiL. By contributing to the project, you'll be helping to make a positive impact on passive radar developers around the globe and advancing the deeper sceintific understanding of this novel technology. Whether you can contribute code, documentation, or simply provide feedback, every contribution helps us move closer to our shared goal.

### The package is organized as follows:

* pyAPRiL: Main package directory

	        *    Max-SIR: Maximum Signal-to-Interference Ratio
	        *    MVDR: Minimum Variance Distortionless Response
	        *    Principal eigenvalue beaformer
	        *    Beamstearing
	        *    Explicit coefficient beamformer
	* **hitProcessor**: Implements a number of hit and plot processing related functions such as the CFAR and the plot extractor. Implemented algorithms:
	    * CA-CFAR
	    *  Target DoA estimator (from multichannel RD matrix using the pyArgus library)
	* **detector** : In this file a number of implementation of the cross-correlation detector can be found.
	    * Cross-correlation detector - Time domain implementation
	    * Cross-correlation detector - Frequency domain implementation
	    * Cross-correlation detector - Batched implementation (Overlap and save)
		* Doppler frequency windowing
	* **metricExtract**: Implements various clutter cancellation and detection performance evaluation function. The supported metrics are the followings:
	    * CA: Clutter Attenuation
	    * Rnf: Noise floor reduction
	    * Mu : Peak-to-channel power ratio
	    * Delta: Estimated target SINR
	    * Alpha: Target peak to noise floor ratio
	    * L: Target peak power loss
	    * Rzdc: Zero Doppler clutter reduction
	    * P: Peak clutter reduction
	    * D: Dynamic range compression
	* **targetParameterCalculator**: Calculates the expected parameters of an observed target (bistatic range, Doppler, ...) from geodetic data.
	* **targetLocalization**: Calculates the location of the target
	* **RDTools**: range-Doppler matrix image export and plotting tools
	* **sim**: IoO simulator (FM)
